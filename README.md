#chat
**Please read carefully in order to get a fine working chat app**<br>
First of all clone this git reposit to your system.<br>
Now open this project in an IDE/text editor(_RECOMMENDED-VS code_).<br>
Now open the terminal and type the command: ` cd ./nodeServer` <br>
After that just write ` npm install`, which will essentially install all the required libraries and dependencies (_nodemon,chatengine etc._)<br>
So now, just open the terminal and type the command: ` nodemon ./index.js`, to get your nodemon server up and running. <br>
Now lastly, open the Local Server(localhost) with index.html and now you can open as many instance of multiple users as you want, and things should work just fine.<br>

**_I am so sorry, but I didn't take the CORS error in consideration so please install a CORS extension in your browser before using the app._**
